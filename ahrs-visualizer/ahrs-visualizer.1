.TH AHRS-VISUALIZER 1
.SH NAME
ahrs-visualizer - Draws a 3D representation of an IMU's orientation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ahrs-visualizer [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ahrs-visualizer reads orientation data on its standard input and uses that
to display a 3D representation of the orientation.

Currently, the presence of GPU-specific code means that it only works
on the Raspberry Pi but it can probably be ported to other boards.
It uses OpenGL ES 2.0.

This program runs fine from the console; you do not need to run X.

This program is meant to be used with \fBminimu9-ahrs\fP, a separate
utility that reads data from the Pololu MinIMU-9 and computes its orientation.
To pipe direction cosine matrix (DCM) data from minimu9-ahrs to
ahrs-visualizer, simply run the following command:
.IP
minimu9-ahrs | ahrs-visualizer
.P
For documentation of the input data format that ahrs-visualizer expects,
please see the documentation of the output format of minimu9-ahrs
in its man page.

The 3D model is a Pololu MinIMU-9 v2.
The X axis is drawn as a red line.
The Y axis is drawn as a green line.
The Z axis is drawn as a blue line.
The acceleration vector is drawn as a cyan line.
The magnetic field vector is drawn as a yellow line.

.SS OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fP
produce help message
.TP
\fB-v, --version\fP
print version number
.TP
\fB-s, --screen-angle \fBANGLE\fR
Specifies the angle of your screen.  Default value is 0.
0 = screen faces South, 90 = West, 180 = North, 270 = East.
Screens that are not mounted vertically are not supported.

.SH FILES
.TP
~/.ahrs-visualizer
Configuration file; each line has the format "option-name=value".
For example, you could write "screen-angle = -33" in this file so
that you don't have to specify the screen angle on the command line
every time you run ahrs-visualizer.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
ASSET_DIR
Specify the directory to load assets (e.g. texture files) from.
