Remarks about the magnetometer : 

It seems that the longer the simulation is, the more accurate
the magnetometer is.
Example: the magnitude of the vector which is supposed to be closed to 
		 1g most of the time, give better results when the simulation
		 is longer.
		 For 3s -> Around 0.57 (seems normal since it's the init period)
		 For 20s -> Around 1.33
		 For 60s -> 1.11871
		 


=====================================================================

Calibration 

Calibration scripts have been modified to produce not hidden calibration
files. 
Those output files are saved in /home/robin/minimu9
Change minimu9.cpp to have corresponding paths

2D & 3D graphs are available.

----------------------------------------

Adding the magnetic declination : 

1) Check www.magnetic-declination.com
2) Go to www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(1°+13%27)+in+radians
	where 1°13' is the declination of the place I currently am 
	(Polytech Montpellier - 14th building)
	
3) I've added it to yaw value : 
	a) go to minimu9-ahrs.cpp
	b) go to void output_euler(quaternion & rotation)
	c) isolate the yaw value from the euler vector
	d) add the declination (+ or - is important and depends on your own
							declination)
