# instantWave project

All software developped and/or used for the **instantWave** project is stored here for
more convenience.

As the IMU used at the moment is the Altimu10 - v5 from Pololu, the programm driving the sensors
of the IMU based on the code furnished by Pololu.
As excellent tutorials are also provided, I have let them in the concerned sections (minimu9-ahrs &
ahrs-vizualizer).
If modifications or addings have been made to a file, it will be precised at the beggining
of each README file.

MATLAB scripts are also available in the related folder. They have been used to anaylze the
data coming from the IMU's sensors (plotting angles, calibration results, statistics etc.)
